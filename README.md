# Ed25519Blake2b

This is a simple library for producing public keys from corresponding private keys using Ed25519, but with Blake2b as the hashing algorithm. Note that this is _not_ a full-featured Ed25519 hashing library at this time, but that could change in the future.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ed25519_blake2b'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ed25519_blake2b

## Usage

Right now there is only one method available for use, that produces a public key from a private key. The private key is currently expected to be 64 bytes in length.

```ruby
Ed25519Blake2b.public_key(private_key)
```
